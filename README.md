### Rinkeby Network Conecction
This project uses a configuration file (rinkeby-config.js which is added on .gitignore file) to connect to Rinkeby Blockchain Test Network.
The file contains a Meta-mask seed and an Infura link to create a connection with this network and deploy the contract. For privacy matters, the revisors are suposed to replace it (in truffle.js file) by their own hardcoded configuration.
